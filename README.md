Project Title: Sprint 13 Project/ Time Series Analysis

Project Description:

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting for the Sweet Lift Taxi Company. The goal is to build and compare multiple predictive models to estimate future taxi order volumes. 

The models explored in this project include:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

LightGBM Regressor

Autoregressive (AR) model

Moving Average (MA) model

ARMA model

SARIMAX model

The workflow includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) stage featuring:

A histogram illustrating the distribution of taxi orders

Time series decomposition plots highlighting the data’s trend, seasonality, and residual components

This project compares both machine learning and statistical time series models to determine which approach delivers the most accurate forecasts for operational planning.
